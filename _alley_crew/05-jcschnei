bio: Why hello!   My name is John Schneiderhan and I’m the Library Technology Specialist at Michigan Tech’s J. Robert Van Pelt and John and Ruanne Opie Library.   I am passionate about education, emerging (and forgotten skills and trades) technologies, collaboration between disciplines and the creating something awesome from things found around the garage or The Alley.  I enjoy working, playing and enjoying the beauty of the Upper Peninsula with friends and family.
