bio: Hey! I'm a third year Civil Engineering Major at Michigan Tech. My passion for
  creativity and thinking outside the box was introduced to me at a  young age,
  and I love when I get a chance to be a part of anything that lets me explore it
  more. In my spare time, you can find me bowling at the nearest lanes, cheering
  on the Detroit Tigers,  or watching Gilmore Girls with a cup of coffee.
