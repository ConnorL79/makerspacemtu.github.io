bio: Hi, I’m Asa! I’m a third year working towards a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in environmental applications. I enjoy making props from video games and movies in any medium, but foam is my favorite. I’ve always wanted to help make a community around building, so the Makerspace is the perfect place to do that! Seeing the wide range of projects pass through is always great. In my free time I like to cross country ski, paint, and play video games.
