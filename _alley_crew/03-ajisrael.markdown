bio: Hello! My name is Alex Israels, and I am third year student here at Michigan Tech. My major area of study is computer engineering with a minor in business economics. I have always loved the idea of turning an idea into a reality as fast and as simple as possible. Now in a world with 3D printers and CNC machines among other desktop tools I am so excited to help other makers turn their ideas into a reality. In my free time I look forward to playing games with my friends, going golfing and fishing, and making things.
