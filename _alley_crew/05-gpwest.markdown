bio: Gi comes from the considerably less snowy and less cold southeast Michigan. She came to Michigan Tech probably because she likes the snow. She joined the great sea of Mechanical Engineers so now most of the free time, which went to interests like playing piano, drawing, and writing, now is spent on calculus and physics. Her favorite food is Thai curry, although spicy burritos are also high on the list. She is interested in the Makers Space by the prototyping and creation of new ideas and loves to use woodworking machines and the 3D printer.
