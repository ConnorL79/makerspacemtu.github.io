bio: Hi there! I'm a senior software engineering student at Tech with a passion for
  design. I've always enjoyed making things and enjoy interactive learning
  experiences. As a University Innovation Fellow I discovered the importance of
  having a space with a culture where students can experiment in an environment
  that focuses on growth and learning from failure, and hope to create that
  environment for all of you. Wanna chat? Send me an email or stop in the space!
