bio: Hey! My name is Magann, and I'm a fifth year student at Michigan Tech. My passion for creativity and thinking outside the box was introduced to me at a young age, and I love when I get a chance to be a part of anything that lets me explore it more. I was the Student Director in the Alley for the 2017-2018 school year and am helping out with the administration of the space before I graduate in Spring 2019. In my spare time, you can find me bowling, cheering on the Detroit Tigers, or watching Gilmore Girls with a cup of coffee.
