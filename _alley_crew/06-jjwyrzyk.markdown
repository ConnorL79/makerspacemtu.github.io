bio: My name is John Wyrzykowski, and I'm a fourth year Mechanical Engineering major at Michigan Tech.  I have loved engineering from a young age, and love woodworking and using the Space to accomplish my goals.  I have had multiple engineering internships, and am eager to apply those skills and knowledge to improve the Makerspace. In addition to engineering, I love the outdoors, and am an avid climber, skier, and mountain biker.
