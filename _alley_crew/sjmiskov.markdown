bio: Hi! I'm a senior computer science student at Michigan Tech interested in
  technology and entrepreneurship. I was drawn to software because of the
  low overhead needed to constantly build something new, iterate, and expand
  on projects. I've joined the Alley team in hopes of expanding my
  experience with making beyond computers, collaborate and learn from others,
  and hopefully create a space that I wish would have been available to me throughout
  my entire college exerpience.
