bio: Hello, my name is Tom Prica, I am pursuing a bachelors in electrical engineering technology and a minor in industrial controls and data acquisition. At school I work as a lab assistant for the EET department where I get to help facilitate hands on learning with electronics and industry software. Outside of school I enjoy volleyball, swimming, and disassembling stuff without knowing how to put it back together.
