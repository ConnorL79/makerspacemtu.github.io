bio: Hey there, how’s she going aye? My name is Emil Johnson and I am a fifth year Biomedical / Mechanical Engineering student at Michigan Tech. I moved to Houghton four years ago with the bold  belief I told myself many others, “Because I like the snow”, and to also begin my academic career at Michigan Tech. Four years later and this belief is still holding true, but is a part of something much more, I now realize. It takes a special kind of person to live in the great white north, and I have been honored to meet so many of them. I have fallen in love with the culture of the U.P., the landscapes and everything in between. Outside of school, you can find me enjoying the weather no matter the temperature. In these past four years I’ve spent my free time attempting to utilize all of the U.P’s natural resources by mountain biking the harbor, rowing down the canal, and skiing in the miles of endless trails. The U.P. has challenged me mentally and physically, who knew I was U.P. for such a challenge.
