bio: Hello Makers! My name is Emil Johnson and I am a fifth year Biomedical & Mechanical student at Michigan Tech. As a dual degree myself, I have a strong belief in the importance of a well rounded set of skills, and that is why I enjoy working in the Alley. I love having the opportunity to work with students from all different disciplinary backgrounds and help them diversify their skills from brainstorming ideas, to bringing their projects to life through the use of a wide variety of tools at their disposal. It is amazing to see what people can do once their are confident in their own abilities.
