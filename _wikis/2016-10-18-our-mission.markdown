#### Statement

We exist to create an environment where everyone in the Michigan Tech community
is encouraged and supported by providing a welcoming space, learning
opportunities, a maker network, and resources.

#### The Alley Function

- Create an environment needed to foster Makerâ€™s designs and innovation.
- Provide resources for Makers.
- Offer classes, seminars, and workshops to the Michigan Tech community and get
those learning opportunities advertised campus wide.
- Expand by way of proposals that achieve success in obtaining equipment needed
for the Alley, such as tools as well as more space needed to accommodate the
demanding need from students.
