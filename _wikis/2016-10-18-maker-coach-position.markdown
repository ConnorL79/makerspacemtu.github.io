Maker Coaches are the glue that will hold
the Alley together. They are the creators, makers, artists, tinkerers,
designers, builders, and inventors that want to share their passions with other
members of the Michigan Tech community. These volunteers will spend time in the
Alley helping Makers learn and create while maintaining an excellent standard of
safety. They will have an opportunity to shape the maker culture and help create
a place where all members of the Michigan Tech community can come together to
make, collaborate together, and learn from each other. This document contains
helpful information on how to make the most of your position as a Maker Coach.
