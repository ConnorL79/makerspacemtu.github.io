##### Dial 9-1-1

##### Michigan Tech Public Safety: 906-487-2216

- Consult the Red book located in the office. Emergency protocol per machine can
be found on the wiki for each machine.
- In the event of an Emergency that has resulted in injury or possible loss of
life dial 9-1-1 immediately. A phone is located in the office.
- If there is a fire, and it is small, put it out and clear the smoke, even if the
fire alarm goes off. Make sure that you always have an exit in the process.
- Always evacuate the building when the fire alarm sounds. Proceed to a safe
location at least 100 feet from the exit.
- Report all fires to the Michigan Tech Public Safety.
- If there is blood, contact facilities to clean it up. Make sure that all
contaminated items are disposed of properly (e.g. no bloody razors in the trash
unless in a labeled container)
- There is a first aid kit in the office, know where it is and get familiar with
what is in it.
- If you are alone after hours when there is an emergency, get to a phone as
quickly as possible and call for help. If you are working alone at night, be
sure that you have a cell phone or access to a phone and 9-1-1 and Michigan Tech
Public Safety's phone numbers are on hand.
- If in doubt, CALL FOR HELP. It is always better to be on the safe side.
