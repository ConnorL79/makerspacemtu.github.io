### We've got some time to fill...

Hey there! Have you ever thought about sharing a cool skill or technique, project, process, or idea with a group of like-minded individuals right here at Tech? Maybe you have something you really enjoy doing that you want to share with others related to creativity, making, innovation, entrepreneurship, or something else we value here in the Alley. Well, we want to help you share you knowledge.

It's looking like renovations in the Alley won't be completed until close to the end of the spring semester, if not sometime early in the summer. In the mean time we are working to put together a series of workshops or discussions focused around topics *you* find interesting. If you or somebody you know has something you think members of the Michigan Tech community would like to hear about, please [send us an email at makerspace@mtu.edu](mailto:makerspace@mtu.edu) and let's get the ball rolling!
