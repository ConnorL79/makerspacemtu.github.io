### Check out our new site!

This is our first post and we would like to welcome you. Check
back here often for updates!

#### How we built it...

We built this site from scratch using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
to generate a static website and blog so we have a lot of flexibility
on where we can host the website but still keep it super easy to update.

We also used the newest [Foundation CSS Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
to create a clean, responsive website for all devices.

If you see any issues or would like to contribute to making this website
better feel free to fork and make a pull request. This website is
[open source on GitHub](https://github.com/makerspacemtu/makerspacemtu.github.io)!
