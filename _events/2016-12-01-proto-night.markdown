#### What's the point?
Collaboration, motivation, learning, uniting idea people with makers, meeting
new people!

#### Why 2 people?
You will be randomly paired with one other person for the whole 2 hours. Pairs
will chat, throw around some ideas, brainstorm, strategize, and implement a very
focused prototype. Groups of 2 tend to have high engagement and low
disagreement. Idea people will be paired with makers (idea people can also
be makers).

#### Why 1 prototype?
Working on something real tends to get the ideas and energy flowing. For idea
people, the meeting can be an easy and fun way to finally get a start on that
prototype you've been thinking about. For makers it can be a low stress way to
get motivated and connected.

#### Why 0 commitment?
By attending the meeting you aren't committing to anything beyond the 2 hours.
This keeps the stress low and ensures you'll meet a new person. Some
pairs may opt to continue the relationship afterward, but that will be the
exception rather than the rule.

#### What should I bring?
Nothing is required. Makers can bring anything they may need that we do not
have in the space. Idea people should bring an idea or two.

#### What if we don't get anything done?
No problem. You still met an interesting new creative-minded person, had
some fun conversations, and most likely learned a lot and got your brain really
fired up for 2 hours.

#### What type of things should we work on?
2 hours isn't much time so pick a simple and achievable goal - a subset of your
larger idea. Start with some brainstorming. Then maybe... Mock up some of the UI
on paper, construct something from straws and pipe cleaners, 3D print a quick
model. Make a very focused prototype out of popsicle sticks and hot glue or an
app. Make a piece or two of the larger idea. Do a proof-of-concept or make a
simple page on Facebook.

#### Are there general guidelines?
1. Collaborate - work together not apart.
2. Keep the dialog going the whole night. Including during building, making, prototyping, sketching, programming.
3. Encourage and incorporate your partner's ideas. Give them equal time to talk.
4. The idea person is not in charge - but rather has equal say regarding what to do.

#### What if makers get paired with makers?
We'll provide some sample ideas, or you can brainstorm and come up with your own.
