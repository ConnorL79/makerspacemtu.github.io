Are you interested in learning web development or Ruby on Rails? Join us for a
short workshop on the basics of Ruby on Rails. Everyone is welcome, and nothing
is required to participate!

No experience is necessary though some basic programming or previous web
development knowledge is helpful! We encourage you to bring a laptop, if
possible, so that you can follow along and try things out. If you plan on
bringing a laptop, please have Ruby on Rails already installed and working so
that you can follow along as we go. The basics for getting started with the
program can be [found here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
Remember that everyone is welcome, and nothing is required to participate. We
look forward to seeing you!
