Are you interested in learning web development or Ruby on Rails? Join us for a
short workshop on the basics of Ruby on Rails. Everyone is welcome and nothing
is required to participate!

It will be helpful (but not required) to have some basic programming or previous
web development knowledge. Additionally, we encourage you to bring your laptop
if possible to follow along and try things out. The workshop assumes you have
Ruby on Rails already installed so if you want to follow along it would be
beneficial to have it installed and working. The basics for getting started can
be [found here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
